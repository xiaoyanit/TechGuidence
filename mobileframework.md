##mobile app technologys

###Native Apps
  
 + Description: Use specific programing language to develop app for one specific platform. Like using objective-C for IOS, java for Android. This kind of app is installed from app store.
  
 + Advantages: Can take full advantage of all the device features. They can use the camera, the GPS, the accelerometer, the compass, the list of contacts and so on. They can also incorporate gestures. 
  And native apps can use the device's notification system and can work offline. And it has the best performance and user experience.
  
 + Disadvantages: One specific programing language can only support one specific platform. It's not cross-platform. It may take highter cost for supporting multipule platform.
  
###Web Apps

 + Description: Web apps are mobile-optimized webpages that look like an app. They are really websites. They are ran by a browser and typically written in HTML5.
  
 + Advantages: Rapid deployment(skip app store auditing),cross-platform
  
 + Disadvantages: Native features are inaccessible in the browser. The notifications, running in the ebackground, accelerometer information, complex gestures.
  

###Hybrid Apps

  Description: Hybrid apps are part native apps, part web apps. It's installed from app store.
  
  Advantages: Cross-platform development and reduce development costs. Can take advantage of the many device features available.Rapid deployment(skip app store auditing)
  
  Disadvantages: Performance is not good as native apps.
  
##How to choose

Device features. Although web apps can take advantage of some features, native apps (and the native components of the hybrid apps) have access to the full paraphernalia of device-specific features, including GPS, camera, gestures, and notifications.

Offline functioning. A native app is best if your app must work when there is no connectivity. In-browser caching is available in HTML5, but it’s still more limited than what you can get when you go native.

Discoverability. Web apps win the prize on discoverability. Content is a lot more discoverable on the web than in an app: When people have a question or an information need, they go to a search engine, type in their query, and choose a page from the search results. They do not go to the app store, search for an app, download it, and then try to find their answer within the app. Although there are app aficionados who may fish for apps in app stores, most users don’t like installing and maintaining apps (and also wasting space on their device), and will install an app only if they expect to use it often.

Speed. Native apps win the speed competition. In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg declared that Facebook’s biggest mistake had been betting on the mobile web and not going native. Up to that point, the Facebook app had been a hybrid app with an HTML core; in 2012 it was replaced with a truly native app. Responsiveness is key to usability.

Installation. Installing a native or hybrid app is a hassle for users: They need to be really motivated to justify the effort. “Installing” a web app involves creating a bookmark on the home screen; this process, while arguably simpler than downloading a new app from an app store, is less familiar to users, as people don’t use bookmarks that much on mobile.

Maintenance. Maintaining a native app can be complicated not only for users, but also for developers (especially if they have to deal with multiple versions of the same information on different platforms): Changes have to be packaged in a new version and placed in the app store. On the other hand, maintaining a web app or a hybrid app is as simple as maintaining a web page, and it can be done as often or as frequently as needed.

Platform independence. While different browsers may support different versions of HTML5, if platform independence is important, you definitely have a better chance of achieving it with web apps and hybrid apps than with native apps. As discussed before, at least parts of the code can be reused when creating hybrid or web apps.

Content restrictions, approval process, and fees. Dealing with a third party that imposes rules on your content and design can be taxing both in terms of time and money. Native and hybrid apps must pass approval processes and content restrictions imposed by app stores, whereas the web is free for all. Not surprisingly, the first web apps came from publications such as Playboy, who wanted to escape Apple’s prudish content censure. And buying a subscription within an iOS app means that 30% of that subscription cost goes to Apple, a big dent in the publishers’ budget.

Development cost. It’s arguably cheaper to develop hybrid and web apps, as these require skills that build up on previous experience with the web. NN/g clients often find that going fully native is a lot more expensive, as it requires more specialized talent. But, on the other hand, HTML5 is fairly new, and good knowledge of it, as well as a good understanding of developing for the mobile web and hybrid apps are also fairly advanced skills.

User Interface. Last but not least, if one of your priorities is providing a user experience that is consistent with the operating system and with the majority of the other apps available on that platform, then native apps are the way to go. That doesn’t mean that you cannot provide a good user experience with a web app or a hybrid app–it just means that the graphics and the visuals will not be exactly the same as those with which users may be already accustomed.

(These issues are discussed in further depth in our full-day training course Mobile Websites and Apps: Essential Usability Principles for Mobile Design, while many more detailed screen-design issues are covered in the seminar Visual Design for Mobile and Tablet.)

To summarize, native apps, hybrid apps, or web apps are all ways to cater to the needs of the mobile user. There is no unique best solution: each of these has their strengths and weaknesses. The choice of one versus the other depends on each company’s unique needs.
